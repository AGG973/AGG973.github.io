    <p>In terms of the breakfast I tasted, Al Ameer Restaurant is a very special restaurant. The menu is diverse and offers many different types of typical<strong> Bahraini breakfast.</strong> The design of the shop is exquisite, the breakfast was
      wonderful, and
      there are no complaints.<strong> It is open from 7 a.m. to 11:15 p.m. daily.</strong>

    <p>
      After breakfast, you can visit the magnificent Budayia beach, which is located near the restaurant and is <strong>suitable for both families and groups of friends.</strong> There is also a wonderful public park right on the beach. There is a
      small park for children in addition to a football field, basketball court, and volleyball court. Individuals who do not know how to swim will benefit greatly from this opportunity since they will be able to get up to neck level in the water
      without a problem.<strong> There is also lots of parking and a snack shop.</strong>

      The reserve was established in 1976 in the <strong>desert district of Sakhir in the Kingdom of Bahrain.</strong> The Al Areen Protected Area is split into two parts: the reserve, the park, and the zoo. It is regarded as one of the most
      attractive leisure locations in Bahrain as its natural settings are perfect for rest and rehabilitation, so you may enjoy the fresh air and artificial lakes.<strong> It is open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday through Thursday, and from 2:00 p.m.
        to 5:00 p.m. on Friday.</strong> Further, there are also several restaurants and cafes where you can eat lunch.
