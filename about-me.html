      <h4>HI, Iâ€™M ALYA!</h4>
      <p>My purpose in creating LocalLooks is to bring you more vacation joy and relieve your travel-planning stress because you deserve an amazing trip.
        I search out the coolest sights and activities as a Bahraini citizen who enjoys sharing her experiences with others.
        Then I develop tour guides for you so you don't have to worry about anything during your journey.
        Finally, enjoy fun with family and friends and return home pleased and rejuvenated. Because that is the whole point of vacation!

        The archipelago nation of the Kingdom of Bahrain consists of more than thirty small islands encircling Bahrain, the main island, off the coasts of Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
        This image represents the map of the Kingdom of Bahrain. Bahrain presently has four governorates following the removal of the Central Governorate in 2014. The Capital Governorate, Muharraq Governorate, Northern Governorate, and
        Southern Governorate are among them.
